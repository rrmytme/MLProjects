## Overview
This project focuses on implementing and evaluating various supervised regression algorithms. The goal is to predict continuous outcomes based on input features.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the datasets used for training and testing.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with exploratory data analysis and model training.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `models/`: Saved models and results.
- `ReadMe.md`: Project documentation.
